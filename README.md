Implementation of FYP CM3015 Machine Learning and Neural Networks Project Idea Title 1: Deep Learning on a Public Dataset

This project is to choose, based on a quantitative evaluation, a well performing machine learning model for used with a publicly available dataset.

I have chosen to work with the UNSW-NB15 dataset and all dataset files can be found on https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/2DhnLGDdEECo4ys?path=%2F
